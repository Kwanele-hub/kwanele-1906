An algorithm  is a procedure for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. It is a  computer program that can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. 
Algorithms are widely used throughout all areas of IT (information technology).
 A search engine algorithm, for example, takes search strings of keywords and operators as input,
  searches its associated database for relevant web pages, and returns results.
An encryption algorithm transforms data according to specified actions to protect it.
Algorithms: It is a step by step procedure of solving a problem.

example 1
problem of multiplying two numbers
Solution
Step 1: Input the numbers as a and b
Step 2: Find the product of a x b
Step 3: Print the result

example 2
To add two numbers
Solution
Step 1: Input the numbers as x, y
Step 2: Sum=x+y
Step 3: Print Sum
In computer programming, there are often many different ways ' algorithms 'to accomplish any given task. Each algorithm has advantages and disadvantages in different situations. Sorting is one place where a lot of research has been done, because computers spend a lot of time sorting lists. Here are five different algorithms that are used in sorting:

Bin sort
Merge sort
Bubble sort
Shell sort
Quicksort
