## css grid
CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for two-dimensional layouts to be created on the web.
 This guide was created as a resource to help you better understand and learn Grid, and was organized in a way I thought made the most sense when learning it.

 CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.
