## Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.Data visualization is information in a graph, chart, or other visual format. It communicates relationships of the data with images.It allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen. D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, you learn how to work with data to create different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.
