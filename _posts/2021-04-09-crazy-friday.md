 ## HAPPY DAY

 It was a dazzling day to day, I got to meet the class of 2017 (first graduates) of TCG.One of the graduates named Sindi gave us a word of motive, 
 which was very inspiaring and motivating.After today's talk I am very inspired and self motivated by the words of a young independent lady who was also self taught from The Coding Ground.

 What I've learned today is that oppoturnity only comes once in life, so you better grab it with both hands and use it  wisely.(Atitude)'be motivated by yourself before acquiring other peoples views'. So much I was taught today and I'm grateful for that.

 ## Expressions and operators
 expression contains arithmetic operators, gives a numeric interpretation to the operands, and produces a numeric result.A logical expression contains relational and logical operators, gives a logical interpretation to the operands, and produces a boolean result: TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).Expressions perform specific actions, based on an operator, with one or two operands. An operand can be a constant, a variable or a function result. Operators are arithmetic, logical, and relational. As with C, some operators vary in functionality according to the data type of the operands specified in the expression.
