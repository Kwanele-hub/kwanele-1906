## React Components

React allows you to  define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide more features which are described in detail
To define a React component class, you need to extend React.Component. Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.


## What is a react function component?
The first and recommended component type in React is functional components. A functional component is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX)

## What are the two types of components?
Components usually come in two types, functional components and class components.

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.
