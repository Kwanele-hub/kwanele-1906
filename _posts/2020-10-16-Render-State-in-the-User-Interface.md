##Render State in the User InterfacePassed

My week has been perfect. I was busy with FreeCodeCamp activities which taught me so much about "Render State in the User InterfacePassed", 
this challenge was very amazing.

State is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary.
 This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM.

To pass the state into another component, you can pass it as a prop.
