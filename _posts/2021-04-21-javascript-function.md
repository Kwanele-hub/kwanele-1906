## Javascript  Functions

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...).A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword. Syntax

## Different type of functions in JavaScript
function square(x) { return x * x; } square(10); // 100.
function validFunctionName(parameter) { return statement; }
function bark() { return "woof-woof"; } bark(); // woof-woof.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when something invokes it (calls it).
