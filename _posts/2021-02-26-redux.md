## Redux


Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, 
server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.It also provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.


Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand newimmutable state based off those changes
Redux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.
