# React connect

The connect() function connects a React component to a Redux store. It provides its connected component with the pieces of the data it needs from the store, and the functions it can use to dispatch actions to the store.Connect allows you to create higher order components that can connect presentational components to the Redux store.The Redux library allows us to implement global state objects accessible from any component across the app; thus, the connect() function enables any sub-routes to in your app to extract the required state object from the store.
