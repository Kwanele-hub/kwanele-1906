## About my first portfolio

Truly speaking I wasn't overwhelmed with everything because I wasn't able to create a folder using a terminal.
Everything seemed to be new but I knew l was wrong because a day before I  was given a portfolio I was told about the basic of git.
I hated myself how I reacted while I  was told to create a portfolio it was like I know nothing at all.
But I like how things are done here you learn through mistakes and being left behind that helps to recover fast. 
Finally, I managed to get it done yesterday and its all thanks to Moral whose our facilitator, he explained everything to be clear.
