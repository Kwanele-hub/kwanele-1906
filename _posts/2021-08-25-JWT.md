# JSON web token
JSON Web Token is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for security transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 

## When should we use JSON Web Tokens?

> Authorization: It is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. 

> Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of security transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed using public/private key pairsâ€”you can be sure the senders are who they say they are.
