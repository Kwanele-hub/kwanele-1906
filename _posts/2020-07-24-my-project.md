### my project

This week I have been busy with Mr Mandla's project of creating a calculator.
This whole project has been stressing me big time because i did not know where to start,
the thing for sure I am still struggling with javascript.
I had to look at tutorials of javascript before attempting any further.

all I could say is that with HTML i am good because at first, I managed to create a calculator
that was able to function without javascript.
with the project, I had to do I was needed to have three codes.
on top of that, I was introduced to code wars, oooh i was a little bit stressed.

I managed to create a calculator but it had errors at first and I could not even notify the mistake because it 
was something very small, it was on a javascript code my calculator was unable to display numbers on the calculator screen
only to find out that I did not write my function for numbers properly.
