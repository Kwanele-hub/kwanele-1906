## How to add  configuration in firebase database

Firebase Remote Config is a cloud service that lets you change the behavior and appearance of your app without requiring users to download an app update. When use the Firebase console or the Remote Config backend APIs to override in-app default values for all app users or for segments of your user base.json configuration file in the root of your project directory. The firebase. json file is required to deploy assets with the Firebase CLI because it specifies which files and settings from your project directory are deployed to your Firebase project.
