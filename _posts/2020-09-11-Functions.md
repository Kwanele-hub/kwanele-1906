## Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

function myFunction(var1, var2) {
  return var1 * var2;
}

function addfunc(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

addfunc = (a, b) => { return a + b; }

This week has been hectic I was busy teaching myself the cash register, its been challenging me since last week Friday.
