## Function expressions

A function expression can be stored in a variable: var x = function (a, b) {return a * b}; After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function.The expression is not allowed at the start of a statement.A function expression is very similar to a function declaration and has almost the same syntax . The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions. A function expression can be used as an(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as soon as it is defined.

All functions are expressions, but not all expressions are functions. A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.
