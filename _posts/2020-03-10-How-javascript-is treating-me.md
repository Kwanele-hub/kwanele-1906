##How javascript is treating me.
truly speaking it is like I'm seeing a ghost, Javascript needs too much focus and understanding because there are some calculations you have to master.
so far I've learnt about what is javascript which is the programming language of Html and the web.
I've learned about the java's data types, and how to use camel-case. In java, you find arithmetic-operators(literals or variables)which are the symbols that represent arithmetic math operations.
There are some floating-points arithmetic to finite elements of the floating-point numbers.
the variables are the symbols used to represent an arbitrary element of a set.
I  wish and hope that coding can become a habit to me, I  love what I'm doing so far.
