## React BIND

Binding in React can be achieved by using a controlled input . A controlled input is achieved by 
binding the value to a state variable and a onChange event to change the state as the input value changes.

## Why do bind functions react?

Binding methods helps ensure that the second snippet works the same way as the first one. With React, you only need to bind the methods you pass to other components.

## Why BIND is used in react?

code during the call to the constructor, so that it can be used later when the function is called.
