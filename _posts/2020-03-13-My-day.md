My day was fine I guess.... because I wasn't doing much. I had to finish off what I left unsettled and I did my free code camp exercise. I also pushed my HTML on my git the one I've been making changes at. I enjoyed today's day it was awesome. I also learned new terminology on the Java basics the dependents and independents variables.
