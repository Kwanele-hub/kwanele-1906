##My days at TCG
wow!there's too much to tell, I've learnt so many things in the academy. When I first came to TCG I was a bit nervous, 
I never taught I can be able to learn how to use Html tags and be creative with CSS.everything is very fabulous and I'm a lot from them.
It's all thanks to the people I've been gathered with at the academy.
