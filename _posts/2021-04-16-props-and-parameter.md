## Props and Parameters

props is a piece of cake! In a nutshell, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React and they are the main mechanism for component communication. Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.

The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.The props are passed as attributes in the JSX that loads the component. The React. Component class you inherit (Square extends React. Component) is providing the props to your "Square" class via inheritance.In JavaScript, you cannot pass parameters by reference; that is, if you pass a variable to a function, its value is copied and handed to the function (pass by value). Therefore, the function can't change the variable. If you need to do so, you must wrap the value of the variable (e.g., in an array).
