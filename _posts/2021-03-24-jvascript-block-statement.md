## Javascrip block statement

A block statement is a sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in braces.Block statement is generally used to group together several statements, so they can be used in a situation that requires you to use a single statement. In some situations, you can use only one statement.The block statement is often called compound statement in other languages. It allows you to use multiple statements where JavaScript expects only one statement. Combining statements into blocks is a common practice in JavaScript. ... Blocks are commonly used in association with if...else and for statements.

The if statement itself is just that, a control flow statement. If the statement is evaluated to true it executes the statement, or block after it. In other words, the block after an if is not required if you just wanted to execute a single line of code.JavaScript statements are the commands to tell the browser to what action to perform. Statements are separated by semicolon (;). JavaScript statement constitutes the JavaScript code which is translated by the browser line by line. Example of JavaScript statement: document. getElementById("demo").


# What is '$' in JavaScript?
The $ represents the jQuery Function, and is actually a shorthand alias for jQuery. It is typically used as a selector (i.e. a function that returns a set of elements found in the DOM).the $ is meant to refer jQuery , in jquery when you want to ad some event to the code you do it like this usually : jquery("element").event(function to define); for saving time in writing code the jquery team decided to make it like this: $("element").event(function to define); so $ == jquery.
