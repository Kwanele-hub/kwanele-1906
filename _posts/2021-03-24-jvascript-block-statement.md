## Javascrip block statement

A block statement is a sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in braces.Block statement is generally used to group together several statements, so they can be used in a situation that requires you to use a single statement. In some situations, you can use only one statement.The block statement is often called compound statement in other languages. It allows you to use multiple statements where JavaScript expects only one statement. Combining statements into blocks is a common practice in JavaScript. ... Blocks are commonly used in association with if...else and for statements.

The if statement itself is just that, a control flow statement. If the statement is evaluated to true it executes the statement, or block after it. In other words, the block after an if is not required if you just wanted to execute a single line of code.JavaScript statements are the commands to tell the browser to what action to perform. Statements are separated by semicolon (;). JavaScript statement constitutes the JavaScript code which is translated by the browser line by line. Example of JavaScript statement: document. getElementById("demo").

The string interpolation in JavaScript is performed by template literals (strings wrapped in backticks ` ) and ${expression} as a placeholder.String interpolation is a process substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. For instance, if you have a template for saying hello to a person like "Hello {Name of person}, nice to meet you!", you would like to replace the placeholder for name of person with an actual name.
