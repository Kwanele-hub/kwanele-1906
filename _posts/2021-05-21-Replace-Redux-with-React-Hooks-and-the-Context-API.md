# Redux with React Hooks and the Context API
React hooks allow you to use local state inside function components, while context API allows you to share state with other components.
States in react projects are two Local states and global states. Local states can only be used within the components where they
were defined. Global states can be shared across multiple components. Previously, defining a global state required the installation of a state management framework such as Redux. The Context API was released, which allows developers to implement a global state without
installing additional libraries.

useState is recommended for handling simple values like numbers or strings. However, when it comes to handling complex data structures,
you’ll need the useReducer hook. For useState, you only need to have a single setValue() function for overwriting existing state values.
For useReducer, you’ll be handling a state object that contains multiple values with different data types in a tree-like structure.
You’ll need to declare functions that can change one or more of these state values. For data types such as arrays, you’ll need to declare
multiple immutable functions for handling add, update and delete actions.
