###Debugging challenge

This week has been a usual week to me because I didn't do things under pressure.
while I was doing freeCodeCamp I came across the "Debugging challenge".
Debugging is the process of removing existing potential errors in software code.
It is used in code to force stop the execution of the code at a breaking point.
In debugging we have two consoles which are the freeCodeCamp console and the browser console.

This challenge i find it much easy in javascript compare to other challenges like ES6, it is straight forward and it makes the coding very easy.
