This week has been a busy week for me because I have been busy with FreeCodeCamp, typing practice and kata.
while I was busy with the kata I came across  the problem of the addition of strings, it was challenging
what I could say is I am still having a problem with javascript here and there but hopefully I will nail it. 

while I was still struggling I came across of what is called string interpolation"$"Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `) (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes.

Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) get passed to a function.

The default function just concatenates the parts into a single string. If there is an expression preceding the template literal (tag here), this is called a tagged template. In that case, the tag expression (usually a function) gets called with the template literal, which you can then manipulate before outputting.

they were very helping.
