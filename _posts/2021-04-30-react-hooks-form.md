## React hooks forms

React Hook Form relies on uncontrolled components, which is the reason why the register function capture ref . This approach reduces the amount of re-rendering that occurs due to a user typing in an input or other form values changing If the React community embraces the Hooks proposal, it will reduce the number of concepts you need to juggle when writing React applications. Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.
