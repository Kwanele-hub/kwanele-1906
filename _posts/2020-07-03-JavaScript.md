## JavaScript

There is so much I am learning here at the coding ground.
Today we got a tutorial about javascript, I've learned about the variables, strings, null, consol.log and array.
variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
The strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
Javascript is a bit challenging because you should get your numbers straight,
there is a challenge that has been tricking me on FreeCodeCamp it is called "stand in line".
Its been a week now doing the very same thing and its challenging big time.
Once I get it right I will be so happy....
