            <p>I am a young empowered teenager who believes in a positive strategy.
                I am 20 years old, I'm a teen mom
                I grew up in a disadvantaged community where life wasn't easy to explore and get a better living.
                Growing up was never easy but I managed to face the world the way it is
                I've faced challenges in life which made me stronger than I was.
                I was once a victim of abuse and suicide, but that didn't stop me from keep moving in life.
                I'm very proud of myself and the person I've become.
